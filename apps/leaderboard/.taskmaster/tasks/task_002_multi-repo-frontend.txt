# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Repository List Page
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new page at `/repos` to display a list of all tracked repositories, sorted by the number of unique contributors over the last three months. Each repository will be represented by a card showing key information.
# Details:
1. **Create Page Component:** Create a new Next.js page at `src/app/repos/page.tsx`.
2. **Develop New Query:** Implement a new query that fetches a list of all repositories, sorted by unique contributor count in the last 90 days (descending). For each repository, the query must also return its name, owner, top 3 all-time contributors, and a time-series of weekly commit counts for the last 90 days.
3. **Build `RepositoryCard` Component:** Create a reusable React component for the repository card. It should display: `{owner}/{name}`, avatars of the top 3 contributors, and a simple line graph for weekly commits using shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS.

# Test Strategy:
1. Navigate to the `/repos` URL.
2. Verify that the page displays a list of repository cards.
3. Check that the list is sorted correctly, with the repositories having the most contributors in the last 3 months appearing first.
4. For each card, confirm the repository name, contributor avatars, and activity graph are displayed correctly.
