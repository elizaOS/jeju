# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and core dependencies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the necessary folder structure and install all required dependencies.
# Details:
Create the project repository with the following structure: `/src/lib/data`, `/src/lib/pipelines`, `/src/app`, `/cli`, `/config`, `/drizzle`, `/data`. Initialize with Bun (`bun init`) and install core dependencies: Next.js 14+, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui, SQLite, and any utility libraries. Set up TypeScript configuration with appropriate tsconfig.json. Create initial package.json with scripts for running the pipeline, database operations, and Next.js commands.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dependencies install correctly without conflicts. Ensure the project structure is created as specified. Test basic commands like `bun run` to confirm the setup is working.
