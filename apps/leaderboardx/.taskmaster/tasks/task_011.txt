# Title: Set up Next.js application structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the Next.js frontend application with routing, layout, and component structure.
# Details:
Set up the Next.js application in `src/app` using the App Router. Create the main layout with navigation components. Implement shadcn/ui for styling and components. Set up utility functions for loading and parsing the exported JSON data. Create reusable components for common UI elements like contributor cards, score displays, and activity timelines. Implement responsive design for different screen sizes. Set up static site generation configuration for deployment.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the Next.js application builds successfully. Test navigation between pages. Check that the layout and components render correctly on different screen sizes. Verify that utility functions correctly load and parse JSON data.
