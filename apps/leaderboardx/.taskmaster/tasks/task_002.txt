# Task ID: 2
# Title: Define core data types and interfaces
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create TypeScript types and interfaces for all data models used throughout the application.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/data/types.ts` with interfaces for: Repository, Contributor, PullRequest, Issue, Review, Comment, Reaction, TagRule, TagPattern, UserTagScore, Summary, and Stats. Include appropriate properties for each interface based on the data model descriptions in the PRD. Define enums for status values, reaction types, and other categorical data. Create utility types for configuration objects that will be used in the pipeline configuration file.

# Test Strategy:
Review the type definitions for completeness against the PRD requirements. Ensure all required properties are included and properly typed. Verify that the types are exported correctly for use in other modules.
