# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop data ingestion pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the pipeline step for ingesting data from GitHub and storing it in the database.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/pipelines/ingest/index.ts` to implement the ingestion pipeline. Use the GitHub API module to fetch data for configured repositories. Implement logic to determine the date range for fetching (either specified or since last fetch). Store the fetched data in the SQLite database using the Drizzle ORM. Implement deduplication logic to avoid storing duplicate events. Add logging to track progress and any issues during ingestion. Implement error handling and retries for API failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test the ingestion pipeline with a small repository to verify data is correctly fetched and stored. Verify incremental fetching works by running the pipeline multiple times. Check that bot users are correctly filtered out based on configuration.
