# Task ID: 1
# Title: Refactor Overall Project Summary Page for Aggregated View
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the existing summary pages at `/day`, `/week`, and `/month` to display aggregated data from all tracked repositories. This involves updating data queries to sum metrics project-wide and fetch a global summary instead of a repository-specific one.
# Details:
1. **Modify `getIntervalSummaryContent` Query:** In `src/app/[interval]/[[...date]]/queries.ts`, update the `getIntervalSummaryContent` function to remove the repository ID parameter and fetch content from the `overallSummaries` table.
2. **Aggregate `getMetricsForInterval`:** Ensure the `getMetricsForInterval` query correctly aggregates statistics (contributor counts, PR/issue totals, lines of code) across all repositories for the selected time interval.
3. **Update Modal Content:** Modify the modals for Stat Cards (Contributors, Pull Requests, Issues) to display aggregated lists from all repositories.

# Test Strategy:
1. Load the `/day`, `/week`, and `/month` pages and verify that the displayed statistics are the sum of all repositories.
2. Click on the 'Contributors', 'Pull Requests', and 'Issues' stat cards to open their respective modals.
3. Confirm that the modal content is an aggregated list of items from across the entire project ecosystem for the selected time frame.
