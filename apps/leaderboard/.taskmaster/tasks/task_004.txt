# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create GitHub API interaction module
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a module to interact with GitHub's GraphQL API for fetching repository data.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/data/github.ts` to handle all GitHub API interactions. Implement functions to fetch pull requests, issues, reviews, comments, and reactions using the GitHub GraphQL API. Include pagination handling to retrieve all data. Implement rate limit awareness and backoff strategies. Create utility functions to transform the raw GitHub API responses into the application's data models. Add environment variable handling for the GitHub token (`GITHUB_TOKEN`). Include filtering logic to exclude bot users as specified in the configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test API calls with a valid GitHub token against a test repository. Verify that all data types are correctly fetched and transformed. Test pagination by fetching a large dataset. Verify rate limit handling by monitoring API usage during tests.
