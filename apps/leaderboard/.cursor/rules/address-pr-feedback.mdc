Use the gh cli to view the pull request mentioned by the user. See the comments and suggestions that coderabbit AI made, read the code it's referencing and determine if its actually a valid suggestion worth implementing or not, then make a todolist to address whichever suggestions you think are relevant / useful and not just trivial. Before implementing each item on the todo list, confirm with me if I want to make the change or ignore the suggestion.
