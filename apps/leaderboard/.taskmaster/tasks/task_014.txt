# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement daily, weekly, and monthly report views
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Create pages for viewing aggregated statistics and AI-generated summaries for different time periods.
# Details:
Implement report view pages for daily (`/daily/[[...date]]`), weekly, and monthly periods. Create components to display aggregated statistics for each time period. Integrate AI-generated summaries into the report views. Implement navigation between different time periods. Add visualizations for key metrics using appropriate charting libraries. Ensure all pages are statically generated during build. Implement fallbacks for missing data or summaries.

# Test Strategy:
Test report views with sample data to verify statistics and summaries are correctly displayed. Test navigation between different time periods. Verify visualizations render correctly with different data sets. Check that pages are correctly generated during the build process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement weekly report view page and components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the weekly report view page with aggregated statistics and AI-generated summaries for weekly time periods.
### Details:
1. Create a new page at `/weekly/[[...date]]` that accepts an optional date parameter.
2. Implement the page layout with sections for statistics and summary content.
3. Create a data fetching function to retrieve weekly aggregated statistics based on the provided date (or default to current week).
4. Implement a component to render the weekly summary markdown from `data/<repoName>/summaries/week/yyyy-mm-dd.md` using react-markdown or Next.js MDX support.
5. Add navigation controls to move between different weeks.
6. Create visualization components for key weekly metrics using an appropriate charting library.
7. Implement fallback UI for missing data or summaries.
8. Ensure the page is configured for static generation during build.
9. Test with various date parameters and verify correct data display.
10. Add appropriate error handling for invalid dates or missing data.

## 2. Implement monthly report view page and components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the monthly report view page with aggregated statistics and AI-generated summaries for monthly time periods.
### Details:
1. Create a new page at `/monthly/[[...date]]` that accepts an optional date parameter.
2. Implement the page layout with sections for statistics and summary content.
3. Create a data fetching function to retrieve monthly aggregated statistics based on the provided date (or default to current month).
4. Implement a component to render the monthly summary markdown from `data/<repoName>/summaries/month/yyyy-mm.md` using react-markdown or Next.js MDX support.
5. Add navigation controls to move between different months.
6. Create visualization components for key monthly metrics using an appropriate charting library.
7. Implement fallback UI for missing data or summaries.
8. Ensure the page is configured for static generation during build.
9. Test with various date parameters and verify correct data display.
10. Add appropriate error handling for invalid dates or missing data.

## 3. Implement unified navigation and report view integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Create a unified navigation system between daily, weekly, and monthly reports and ensure consistent UI/UX across all report views.
### Details:
1. Create a shared navigation component that allows switching between daily, weekly, and monthly views.
2. Implement date synchronization so that switching between views maintains the selected time period (e.g., switching from weekly to monthly view should show the month containing the selected week).
3. Create shared UI components for consistent styling across all report views.
4. Implement a unified data fetching layer that can be used by all report views.
5. Add breadcrumb navigation to show the current time period and context.
6. Create a shared layout component that wraps all report views for consistent UI.
7. Implement URL synchronization so the URL always reflects the current view and time period.
8. Add keyboard shortcuts for navigating between time periods and views.
9. Ensure responsive design works consistently across all report views.
10. Test navigation flows between different report views and time periods.
11. Add appropriate loading states and transitions between views.

## 4. Implement daily report view page and components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the daily report view page with aggregated statistics and AI-generated summaries for daily time periods.
### Details:
1. Create a page at `/daily/[[...date]]` that accepts an optional date parameter.
2. Implement the page layout with sections for statistics and summary content.
3. Create a data fetching function to retrieve daily statistics based on the provided date (or default to latest date).
4. Add navigation controls to move between different days.
5. Create visualization components for key daily metrics.
6. Implement fallback UI for missing data or summaries.
7. Ensure the page is configured for static generation during build.
8. Test with various date parameters and verify correct data display.
9. Add appropriate error handling for invalid dates or missing data.
