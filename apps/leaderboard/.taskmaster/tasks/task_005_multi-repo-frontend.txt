# Task ID: 5
# Title: Finalize Navigation and Perform End-to-End Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the new repository pages into the main site navigation and conduct end-to-end testing of the new user flow, ensuring all links between pages work as expected.
# Details:
1. **Add Navigation Link:** In the main site navigation component, add a new link to the Repository List page (`/repos`).
2. **Link List to Detail:** Ensure that clicking on a `RepositoryCard` on the `/repos` page correctly navigates to its corresponding `/repos/{owner}/{name}` detail page.
3. **Verify All Links:** Perform a full review of the new pages to ensure all internal and external links (e.g., to GitHub, to user profiles) are functional.

# Test Strategy:
1. Start at the main summary page and click the new 'Repositories' navigation link.
2. From the `/repos` list page, click on a repository to navigate to its detail page.
3. From the repository detail page, click on a contributor's name to navigate to their user profile page.
4. Verify that the entire flow is smooth, all pages load correctly, and all data is consistent.
