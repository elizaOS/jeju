# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop CLI interface for pipeline steps
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a command-line interface to run individual pipeline steps and manage the overall workflow.
# Details:
Create `cli/analyze-pipeline.ts` to implement the CLI interface. Use a command-line argument parsing library to handle commands and options. Implement commands for each pipeline step: `ingest`, `process` (or `score`), `export`, and placeholders for future commands like `summarize`. Add options for specifying date ranges, repositories, and other parameters. Implement help text and usage examples. Create a combined command to run the full pipeline in sequence. Add error handling and logging for all commands.

# Test Strategy:
Test each CLI command with various options to verify they work as expected. Test the full pipeline command to ensure all steps run in the correct sequence. Verify error handling by testing with invalid inputs and checking that appropriate error messages are displayed.
