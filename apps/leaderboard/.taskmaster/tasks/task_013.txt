# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement AI summary generation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the pipeline step for generating AI-powered summaries of project and contributor activity.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/pipelines/summarize/index.ts` to implement the summary generation pipeline. Implement integration with OpenRouter API for AI model access. Create prompts for project summaries and contributor summaries. Implement logic to gather relevant data for summarization (PR titles, issue summaries, key stats). Add configuration options for AI models per time interval. Implement caching to avoid regenerating summaries unnecessarily. Save generated summaries as JSON files in the specified structure. Add error handling and retries for API failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test summary generation with sample data to verify summaries are correctly generated and saved. Test with different AI models to ensure compatibility. Verify error handling by simulating API failures. Check that the generated summaries are informative and accurate based on the input data.
