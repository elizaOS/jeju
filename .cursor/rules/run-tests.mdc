description: Run tests yourself

You should ALWAYS run the tests after you make any change and verify all tests pass. You should run the tests yourself. This includes playwright tests. For crypto, use dappwright (@tenkeylabs/dappwright) since it supports metamask and crypto and all that.

ALWAYAS RUN THE TESTS. ALWAYS RUN THEM YOURSELF.

Do not wait for the user to run the tests. Assume that if you haven't tests your code, it's broken.

You CAN run the tests. If you can't fix the underlying stuff and then run them again and again until it all works.

ALWAYS run frontend testing with Synpress. Don't make a website or anything that requires user feedback-- this just slows down iteration process.
