# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement pipeline configuration system
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the configuration system for defining repositories, scoring rules, and other pipeline settings.
# Details:
Create `config/pipeline.config.ts` to define the configuration schema and default values. Implement configuration for: repositories to track, bot users to ignore, AI summary settings (enabled flag, API keys, models), and TagRule definitions with patterns and scoring logic. Create a configuration loader that validates the configuration and provides type-safe access to settings. Implement a system to override configuration values using environment variables where appropriate. Document the configuration options and format in comments.

# Test Strategy:
Create a test configuration and verify it loads correctly. Test validation by introducing invalid configurations and ensuring appropriate errors are thrown. Verify environment variable overrides work as expected.
