# Task ID: 15
# Title: Set up CI/CD workflows and data management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10, 12, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement GitHub Actions workflows for automation and set up the data branch management strategy.
# Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`: `run-pipelines.yml` for daily pipeline execution, `pr-checks.yml` for code quality checks, and `deploy.yml` for website deployment. Implement custom actions for database management (`restore-db`, `pipeline-data`). Set up the `_data` branch strategy for storing historical data and database dumps. Create the data synchronization utility (`data:sync`) to allow developers to sync with production data. Implement error handling and notifications for workflow failures. Add documentation for the CI/CD process and data management strategy.

# Test Strategy:
Test each GitHub Actions workflow to verify it runs correctly. Test the data branch management by simulating pipeline runs and checking that data is correctly stored and retrieved. Test the data synchronization utility to ensure it correctly syncs local environments with production data. Verify error handling by simulating failures in different parts of the workflows.
