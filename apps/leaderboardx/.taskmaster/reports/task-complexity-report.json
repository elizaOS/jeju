      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of report views into specific subtasks covering: 1) route and page structure setup, 2) data aggregation and fetching logic, 3) visualization components, 4) AI summary integration, and 5) navigation and time period controls",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple interconnected components including routing, data aggregation, visualization, AI integration, and navigation controls. The complexity comes from handling different time periods, ensuring static generation, implementing fallbacks, and creating visualizations. The task has dependencies on other tasks and requires both frontend and data processing work."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of the activity-centric scoring system into specific subtasks covering: 1) data model design and schema changes, 2) activity-specific scoring logic implementation, 3) aggregation system development, 4) API modifications and backward compatibility, and 5) data migration and performance optimization",
      "reasoning": "This task represents a fundamental architectural change to the scoring system, shifting from contributor-centric to activity-centric. It requires new data models, complex scoring logic for different activity types, aggregation systems, data migration, caching for performance, and maintaining backward compatibility. The lack of dependencies suggests this is a foundational change that will impact multiple system components."
