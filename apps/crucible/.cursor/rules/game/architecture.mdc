The game package is Vite+React application running with Tauri. When it starts up, it runs 'elizaos start' in the background, which starts up the elizaos server with a default agent.

New functionality can be added to the agent through plugins. This includes backend routes, frontend tab pages as well as agent actions, services, context providers ("providers") and action evaluators ("evaluators").

We import as much as we can from elizaos, the agent framework we are building on. The game's api-client uses @elizaos/api-client to connect to the CLI server.
