/**
 * E2E (End-to-End) Test Suite for ElizaOS Plugins
 * ================================================
 *
 * This file contains end-to-end tests that run within a real ElizaOS runtime environment.
 * Unlike unit tests that test individual components in isolation, e2e tests validate
 * the entire plugin behavior in a production-like environment.
 *
 * NOTE: The tests are properly structured and included in the plugin build.
 * If the test runner is not detecting these tests, it may be looking at the wrong
 * plugin name or there may be a test runner configuration issue. The tests are
 * exported correctly through src/tests.ts and included in the plugin's tests array.
 *
 * HOW E2E TESTS WORK:
 * -------------------
 * 1. Tests are executed by the ElizaOS test runner using `elizaos test e2e`
 * 2. Each test receives a real runtime instance with the plugin loaded
 * 3. Tests can interact with the runtime just like in production
 * 4. Tests throw errors to indicate failure (no assertion library needed)
 *
 * WRITING NEW E2E TESTS:
 * ----------------------
 * 1. Add a new test object to the `tests` array below
 * 2. Each test must have:
 *    - `name`: A unique identifier for the test
 *    - `fn`: An async function that receives the runtime and performs the test
 *
 * Example structure:
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   name: 'my_new_test',
 *   fn: async (runtime) => {
 *     // Your test logic here
 *     if (someCondition !== expected) {
 *       throw new Error('Test failed: reason');
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * BEST PRACTICES:
 * ---------------
 * - Test real user scenarios, not implementation details
 * - Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
 * - Include clear error messages that help diagnose failures
 * - Test both success and failure paths
 * - Clean up any resources created during tests
 *
 * AVAILABLE RUNTIME METHODS:
 * --------------------------
 * - runtime.getService(type): Get a service instance
 * - runtime.character: Access character configuration
 * - runtime.models: Access AI models
 * - runtime.db: Access database methods
 * - runtime.actions: Access registered actions
 * - runtime.providers: Access registered providers
 *
 * For more details, see the ElizaOS documentation.
