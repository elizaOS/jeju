# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement database schema and ORM setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the SQLite database schema using Drizzle ORM and set up database connection utilities.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/data/schema.ts` to define all database tables using Drizzle's schema definition syntax. Tables should include: repositories, contributors, pullRequests, issues, reviews, comments, reactions, tagRules, and userTagScores. Define appropriate columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. Create `src/lib/data/db.ts` to handle database connection and provide a reusable DB client. Implement functions for database initialization and basic CRUD operations. Set up Drizzle migration scripts in package.json (`db:generate`, `db:migrate`, `db:studio`).

# Test Strategy:
Generate and apply an initial migration to verify the schema is valid. Test database connection and basic CRUD operations with sample data. Verify that all tables are created with the correct structure and relationships.
