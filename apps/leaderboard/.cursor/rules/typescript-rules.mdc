# Typescript Rules

- Dont cast to `any` type when you have a type error, instead think about the underlying issue causing the error and if/how you can update the related code to respect full typesafety.
- Avoid manual type signatures on functions and vars whenever possible, always prefer to use inference.
- Before declaring new Interfaces, search the codebase and types files to see if there's existing type definitions / zod schemas you can use
- IMPORTANT: Dont create manual type definitions for returns types on query functions that query the database and return some data from it. Rely on type inference instead since we have end to end type safety.
- avoid adding comments to code that is self explanatory
- For testing, use bun.sh test runner, and import from bun:test (https://bun.sh/docs/cli/test)

# UI components

- The project is using tailwind, shadcn/ui for ui components. When needing a new shadcn component that isnt installed, dont add it manually, instead use the shadcn cli with `bunx shadcn@latest`.
