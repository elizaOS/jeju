# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement leaderboard and profile pages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the main leaderboard page and individual contributor profile pages.
# Details:
Implement the leaderboard page at `/leaderboard` to display ranked contributors based on scores. Include filtering options for time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, all-time). Create contributor profile pages at `/profile/[username]` to show detailed information about individual contributors. Include score breakdown, activity timeline, expertise tags, and historical contribution data. Implement data loading from the exported JSON files. Add sorting and filtering options for the leaderboard. Ensure all pages are statically generated during build.

# Test Strategy:
Test the leaderboard page with sample data to verify contributors are correctly ranked and displayed. Test profile pages for different contributors to ensure all information is correctly shown. Verify filtering and sorting options work as expected. Check that pages are correctly generated during the build process.
