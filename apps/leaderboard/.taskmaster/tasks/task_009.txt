# Task ID: 9
# Title: Create data export functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the pipeline step for exporting processed data to JSON files for frontend consumption.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/pipelines/export/index.ts` to implement the export pipeline. Query the database for processed data within specified date ranges. Generate JSON files organized by repository and time interval (daily, weekly, monthly). Implement file structure as specified in the PRD (e.g., `data/elizaos_eliza/day/stats/stats_2024-01-01.json`). Ensure exported data includes all necessary information for the frontend. Add options to control which data types and time periods are exported. Implement error handling and logging.

# Test Strategy:
Test the export pipeline with processed data to verify JSON files are correctly generated with the expected structure. Verify all required data is included in the exports. Check that the file organization matches the specified structure.
