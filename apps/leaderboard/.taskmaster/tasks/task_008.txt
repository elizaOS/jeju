# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build data processing pipeline
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the main processing pipeline that analyzes ingested data and applies scoring rules.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/pipelines/contributors/index.ts` to implement the main processing pipeline. Integrate the scoring engine to process all contributors and their activities. Implement logic to calculate aggregate statistics for repositories and time periods. Create functions to identify expertise areas based on tag scores. Implement any additional analysis required for the frontend display. Ensure the pipeline can be run incrementally to process only new data since the last run. Add progress reporting and error handling.

# Test Strategy:
Test the processing pipeline with sample data to verify it correctly analyzes and scores contributions. Verify incremental processing works correctly. Check that all required statistics and derived data are calculated and stored properly.
