# EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

Don't disable working code. Don't comment plugins out. Your goal is to fix these plugins, so comenting them out just hides real bugs.

Your goal is to fix code. Commenting out working code breaks it worse and hides errors, giving a false sense of confidence.

Don't comment out files, don't comment out working imports, don't disable plugins. Focus on fixing the errors you see, not simplifying the problem (which often hides the errors and adds bloat).

I repeat: DO NOT just make radical infrastructure changes or comment out important parts.

DO NOT create minimal workflows. Test the full worlflow. You will only add more bugs if you do that. If you fix the full workflow, the bugs go away.

If you create a minimal test or workflow or you comment out an important section of code arbitrarily then you will be fired.
