# One build, one dev, one start, one test

It is very important that when we run 'npm run build' we get ALL build steps. No npm run build:*

Same with start, test and dev

EVERY TEST SHOULD RUN WITH 'bun run test'

EVERYTHING SHOULD START WHEN RUNNING 'bun run start'

EVERYTHING SHOULD START IN WATCH MODE WHEN RUNNING 'bun run dev'

EVERYTHING SHOULD BUILD, ALL SERVERS AND CONTAINERS AND APPS AND EVERYTHING when running 'bun run build'

ONE SCRIPT = ONE ACTION

Each package.json MUST contain 'dev', 'start', 'build', 'test' and 'lint' and ONLY those

All binary compilation etc must be encapsulated

No tauri:dev -- just dev
No build:server -- just build
