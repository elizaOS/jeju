# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Repository Detail Page
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new dynamic page at `/repos/{owner}/{name}` to display detailed analytics for a single repository. The page will feature a two-column layout similar to the user profile page.
# Details:
1. **Create Dynamic Page:** Implement a new dynamic page at `src/app/repos/[owner]/[name]/page.tsx`.
2. **Develop `getRepoProfile` Query:** Create a new query that accepts `owner` and `name` to fetch all necessary data for the specific repository: the AI-generated description, monthly summaries, stats (PRs, Issues, contributors), daily commit activity for the last year, top 10 all-time contributors, and a list of active PRs.
3. **Build UI:** Assemble the page using existing and new components. The header will show the repo name, GitHub link, and AI description. The left column will contain a `SummaryCard` and a daily activity heatmap. The right column will show stat cards, a list of the top 10 contributors (linking to their profiles), and a list of active PRs.

# Test Strategy:
1. Navigate to a repository detail page, e.g., `/repos/elizaos/eliza`.
2. Verify that the header displays the correct repository name and the AI-generated description.
3. Check that all data displayed on the page (summaries, stats, heatmap, contributors, PRs) is specific to that repository.
4. Confirm that links to contributor profiles are working correctly.
