/**
 * @title ElizaOS Token
 * @author Jeju Network
 * @notice Standard ERC-20 token that can be used as a payment token in the Jeju ecosystem
 * @dev This is a standard ERC-20 token that receives equal treatment with all other tokens.
 *      It can be used with the paymaster system where users pay transaction fees in this token
 *      instead of ETH. The paymaster converts these tokens to ETH using liquidity provider pools.
 *
 * Security Features:
 * - Owner-controlled minting for supply management
 * - Supply cap at 10 billion tokens (10x initial supply)
 * - Standard OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation
 * - Initial supply: 1 billion tokens
 *
 * Integration:
 * - Users must approve the paymaster contract to spend tokens
 * - Tokens are collected by paymaster after transaction execution
 * - Fees are distributed: 50% to apps, 50% to liquidity providers
 *
 * Note: This token receives no special treatment - it's equal to all other payment tokens
