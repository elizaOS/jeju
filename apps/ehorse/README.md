# 🐴 eHorse Racing

> **TEE-based contest oracle demonstrating provably fair outcomes**

A production-ready TEE-based horse racing game that serves as a reference implementation for Trusted Execution Environment contests.

## 🎯 What It Does

1. **4 horses race** every 90 seconds (Thunder, Lightning, Storm, Blaze)
2. **Game runs in TEE** - provably fair via attestation
3. **Grace period** - prevents MEV sandwich attacks
4. **Integrated with Predimarket** - Prediction market betting
5. **Discoverable via Gateway** - ERC-8004 metadata
6. **Standard interfaces** - IPredictionOracle + IContestOracle
7. **TEE attestation** - Verifiable proof of execution

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
cd apps/ehorse

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start local blockchain (separate terminal)
anvil

# Deploy all contracts (one command)
bun run deploy

# Start keeper + API
source .env && bun run dev
```

That's it! The game is now running fully on-chain:
- ✅ Races created & managed by EHorseGame contract
- ✅ Results stored on-chain (trustless)
- ✅ Markets auto-created on Predimarket
- ✅ Discoverable via Gateway/Registry
- ✅ All state verifiable

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contract (Solidity)
- **Contest.sol** - TEE contest oracle
  - Implements `IPredictionOracle` (for Predimarket)
  - Implements `IContestOracle` (generic contests)
  - Verifies TEE attestation
  - Grace period for MEV protection
  - ERC-8004 metadata for discovery

### TEE Service (TypeScript)
- **keeper.ts** - TEE automation service
  - Runs game logic in TEE container
  - Generates attestation proof
  - Announces contests
  - Starts grace period (trading freeze)
  - Publishes results with attestation

### Flow
1. **Announce**: TEE announces contest (PENDING)
2. **Start**: Trading opens (ACTIVE) - 60s
3. **Grace Period**: Trading frozen (GRACE_PERIOD) - 30s
4. **Publish**: TEE publishes results with attestation (FINISHED)

### API (Optional)
- **index.ts** - Minimal HTTP server
  - Queries contract state
  - Serves frontend
  - Health checks

## 📝 Contracts

All deployed with `bun run deploy`:

```
✅ Contest        - TEE contest oracle (with attestation verification)
✅ elizaOS        - Payment token  
✅ Predimarket    - Betting markets (with GameType support)
✅ MarketFactory  - Auto-creates markets from events
```

**Contest.sol Features:**
- TEE attestation verification
- Grace period enforcement
- Container hash approval system
- Generic for any contest type

## 🤖 Agent Integration

### A2A Discovery

Agents can discover the game via ERC-8004 registry or direct connection:

```bash
# Fetch Agent Card
curl http://localhost:5700/.well-known/agent-card.json
```

Agent Card includes 3 skills:
- `get-race-status` - Current race info
- `get-horses` - List of horses
- `get-race-history` - Past race results

### Example Agent (TypeScript)

```typescript
// Minimal prediction agent
const agentCard = await fetch('http://localhost:5700/.well-known/agent-card.json');
const skills = agentCard.skills;

// Get current race
const statusSkill = skills.find(s => s.id === 'get-race-status');
const raceStatus = await callA2ASkill(statusSkill.id);

// If race is pending, make prediction
if (raceStatus.race.status === 'pending') {
  // Pick random horse (or use strategy)
  const prediction = Math.floor(Math.random() * 4) + 1;
  
  // Bet on Predimarket
  await predimarket.buy(raceStatus.race.id, prediction, amount);
}
```

## 📊 Integration with Predimarket

### How It Works

```
TEE announces contest (PENDING)
  ↓
Contest starts (ACTIVE)
  ↓
Predimarket creates market automatically
  ↓
Agents place bets (60 seconds)
  ↓
Grace period starts (GRACE_PERIOD)
  ↓
Trading frozen (30 seconds) - prevents MEV
  ↓
TEE publishes results + attestation (FINISHED)
  ↓
Contract verifies TEE attestation
  ↓
Predimarket resolves market
  ↓
Winners claim payouts
```

**Key Security Features:**
- Game runs in isolated TEE container
- Grace period prevents MEV sandwich attacks
- TEE attestation proves results are legit
- Only approved container hashes accepted

### Binary Mapping

Since PredictionOracle uses binary outcomes:
- **Horse 1-2 wins** → `outcome = false` (NO)
- **Horse 3-4 wins** → `outcome = true` (YES)

Agents should bet:
- Thunder or Lightning → Bet NO on Predimarket
- Storm or Blaze → Bet YES on Predimarket

## 🎮 For Agents

### Using Caliguland Generic Agents

The Caliguland generic agents can play eHorse with ZERO code changes:

```bash
cd ../caliguland/caliguland-agents

# Point to eHorse server
export GAME_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5700

# Start agents
bun run dev
```

Agents will:
1. Discover eHorse via Agent Card
2. Load the 3 skills dynamically
3. Query race status
4. Make predictions on Predimarket automatically

### Custom Prediction Agent

```bash
# Set up environment
export PREDIMARKET_ADDRESS=0x...       # From .env
export ELIZAOS_ADDRESS=0x...          # From .env
export AGENT_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...         # Your agent's private key
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545

# Run the example agent
bun run agent
```

The example agent will:
1. Connect to eHorse and monitor races
2. Automatically bet on random horses (Storm or Blaze)
3. Approve elizaOS spending for Predimarket
4. Place bets when markets are created
5. Show results in console

See `scripts/example-agent.ts` for the full implementation.

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Check keeper is running
curl http://localhost:5700/health
# Should show: "mode": "on-chain", "keeper": true

# Get current race (queries EHorseGame contract)
curl http://localhost:5700/api/race

# Check contract directly
cast call $EHORSE_GAME_ADDRESS "getCurrentRace()(bytes32)"

# Watch race events
cast logs --address $EHORSE_GAME_ADDRESS --follow
```

## 🚢 Deployment

### Localnet

```bash
# 1. Start anvil
anvil

# 2. Deploy contracts (in another terminal)
cd apps/ehorse
bun run deploy

# 3. Start eHorse
source .env
bun run dev

# 4. (Optional) Run agent
bun run agent

# 5. Open browser
open http://localhost:5700
```

### Production

```bash
# Build
bun run build

# Deploy contracts on production chain
RPC_URL=https://... \
PRIVATE_KEY=0x... \
bun run deploy

# Start server
source .env
bun run start
```

## 🎲 How Betting Works

1. **TEE announces** contest (PENDING)
2. **Contest starts** - trading begins (ACTIVE)
3. **Predimarket** auto-creates market for this contest
4. **Agents bet** on which horse will win (60 seconds)
5. **Grace period** starts - trading frozen (GRACE_PERIOD, 30s)
6. **TEE publishes** results with attestation (FINISHED)
7. **Contract verifies** attestation and container hash
8. **Predimarket resolves** market
9. **Winners claim** payouts

**Why Grace Period?**
- Prevents MEV bots from sandwich attacking result publication
- 30 second freeze between trading close and results
- No one can front-run the outcome

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Demo for Investors
Show prediction markets in action with instant gratification (1-minute races).

### 2. Agent Testing
Test prediction agents without complex game logic.

### 3. Market Mechanics Demo
Demonstrate oracle → market → resolution flow.

### 4. Educational
Learn how prediction markets work without distractions.
