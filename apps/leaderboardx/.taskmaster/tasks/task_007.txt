# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement scoring engine and rules processing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the scoring engine that applies TagRules to calculate contributor scores based on their activity.
# Details:
Create `src/lib/pipelines/contributors/scoring.ts` to implement the scoring engine. Develop pattern matching logic to apply TagRules to different content types (file paths, commit messages, PR titles, etc.). Implement score calculation based on matched patterns, including handling of multipliers, caps, and other modifiers. Create functions to update the userTagScores table with calculated scores. Implement logic to handle score accumulation over time, potentially with decay or other time-based adjustments. Add detailed logging for score calculations to aid in debugging and transparency.

# Test Strategy:
Create test TagRules and sample contribution data. Verify that patterns match correctly and scores are calculated as expected. Test edge cases like very high activity, no matches, and multiple rule matches. Verify that scores are correctly stored and updated in the database.
